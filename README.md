# _THE BOOKSHELF CLI APP_

#### By _**Margarita Morozova & Jackson Beytebiere**_

## Description
This application is a virtual bookshelf that allows users to organize their book collection and keep track of books they would like to read in the future. The Bookshelf was created for Flatiron's Module 1 project to demonstrate working knowledge of Ruby, Active Record Associations, CRUD methods and working with a database.

Functionality of The Bookshelf includes:
1. Creating a bookshelf associated with a username
2. Adding books to the bookshelf including the author name and genre
3. Searching the books on the bookshelf by author name or genre
4. Viewing bookshelf collection
5. Removing a book or entire bookshelf
